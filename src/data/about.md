# INTRO
Hi! I'm Stephen. I'm currently a sophomore at Brown University studying computational biology and pieceing together the [Open Curriculum](https://www.brown.edu/academics/undergraduate/open-curriculum)!
Iâ€™m particularly excited about how we can leverage computational approaches to drive progress in healthcare and biotechnology. 
I love genomics, programming, and sharing my experiences with others (hence the website)!

In my free time I like to explore around Providence, watch hockey, and spend time with friends.

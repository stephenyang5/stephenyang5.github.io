# INTRO
Hi! I'm Stephen. I'm a rising junior at Brown University studying computational biology and pieceing together the [Open Curriculum](https://www.brown.edu/academics/undergraduate/open-curriculum)!
Iâ€™m particularly excited about how we can design computational approaches to drive progress in healthcare and biotechnology. 

Outside of class, I've been working on a few side projects, some of which I'm starting to add this site, learning some front-end development (hence the website), and doing research!

In my free time I enjoy getting out into nature, playing ice hockey, and making music with friends. Always up for a good conversation -- especially about science, design, or whatever odd problem you're working on! 

If you're interested in collaborating, chatting, or just saying hi, feel free to reach out!
